A small extenstion to retrieve upstream source informations for all
containers in your cluster.

## Prepare

0. Install prerequisites:
   1. [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo)
   2. [Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign)
1. Create a token here: https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/
2. Then do podman login: `podman login -u='$TOKEN_NAME' -p=$TOKEN_VALUE`

## Usage

After logging into the OpenShift cluster you can run:

    $ oc-get-upstream-sources all
    â€¦

In order to fetch all the upstream source informations for all container images
currently being used on the cluster - if the container is providing this information.

Image labels are checked first, build info from In-Toto attestation is used as a fallback.
Please notice that the [In-Toto attestation format is not considered production-ready](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign?tab=readme-ov-file#what--is-not--production-ready)
